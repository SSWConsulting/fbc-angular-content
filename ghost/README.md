## Get content from ghost
Node script to connect to ghost admin api using js client and download content and images.
This is how we got the initial content - we shoudn't run this after any changes have been made directly to the content folder.

## usage
- requires node + npm
- npm i
- rename config.template.js to config.js
- add ghost admin API key for firebootcamp.ghost.io to config.js
- run: node app.js
